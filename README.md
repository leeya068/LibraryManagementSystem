# LibraryManagementSystem

This is a Java-based Library Management System designed to manage a collection of books. The system allows users to add new books, borrow and return books, and view all available books through a menu-driven interface. It demonstrates key Java programming concepts, including flow control statements, loops, arrays, file input/output, inheritance and polymorphism, and exception handling.

The project uses a real-world dataset of library books from Kaggle, storing book information such as Title, Author, and Year. Users can interact with the system, and all changes are persisted to a file, ensuring the library data is saved between sessions.

Key Features:
1. Menu-driven interface with selection and looping for repeated actions
2. Stores books in an array
3. Reads from and writes to a CSV file using file I/O
4. Implements inheritance and polymorphism with a Book class (and potential extension to other library items)
5. Includes exception handling for invalid inputs and file errors

Dataset Used: Library Books Dataset on Kaggle
